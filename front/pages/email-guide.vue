        <p>Every day, Daily Idea sends you an email to remind to submit an idea.</p>
        <p>We'll store all your ideas for you so you can read them, update them, or add on to them later</p>
        <p>When we send you the email, you should just respond to the email.</p>
        <p>The first line of the email will become the title of your idea.</p>
        <p>The rest of the email will be details or a summary of your idea</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <p>An App for Renting Out Extra Rooms In You House For Money</p>
        <p>It'd be awesome if there was an app where I could post my extra bedroom and if people were visiting Chicago, they could rent it out. It could be cheaper than hotels so the visitors would benefir, and I would make a little extra money!</p>

        <p>Also, I could give them personalized local tips for exploring the city!</p>
        <p>Maybe I'll call it... Airbnb!</p>
